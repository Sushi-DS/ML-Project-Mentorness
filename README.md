Predictive Modeling for Disease Diagnosis

Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for healthcare professionals to accurately classify individuals into diseased or non-diseased categories based on their health attributes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the goal is to create a reliable tool that assists in disease diagnosis and prognosis.

Dataset
The dataset contains various health-related attributes such as cholesterol levels, blood cell counts, hormone levels, and other physiological measurements. Each individual's health status is indicated by a binary indicator: 1 for diseased and 0 for non-diseased.

Objectives
1. Preprocess the data: Handle missing values, scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables (if any).
2. Build machine learning models: Utilize algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosting classifiers.
3. Evaluate model performance: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Compare different models: Plot and analyze performance metrics to determine the best-performing model.

Contribution Guidelines
Contributions to the project are welcome! You can contribute by:
- Adding new features or preprocessing techniques.
- Implementing additional machine learning models.
- Improving existing code and documentation.
